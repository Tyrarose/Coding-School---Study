Dear Sir Erwin,
Good day!
To begin with, one week is undoubtedly enough for a student to finish a single page activity.
Yet, I apologize for submitting Module 2 Activity 1 today (September 26,2020).
This is for the honest reason that I had difficulties with time management.
Also, I failed to submit on the given due date because I am still coping with the new scheme of learning.
Iâ€™m looking forward to learn from this and withstand this new system of learning.
I also hope this would be the first and the last time. 
Hoping for your understanding and kind consideration. Thank you and God bless.
Your student,
Tyra Clemente
